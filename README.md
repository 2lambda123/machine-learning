# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

1. Gradient Descent (Batch/Stochastic)

2. Newton Method for Logistic Regression

3. Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

4. Naive Bayes (Multivariate/Multinomial)

5. Support Vector Machine (Binary/Multiclass)

6. Neural Network

7. K Means

*Note that I have also included an optimized Naive Bayes implementation with memoization cuz sklearn is really too slow for any practical use.*
